To do:
- Update user guide after switch to Lucene.
- Use "-L" or "--filter" parameter to Ctags to use a single process for
  each buffer save/load.
- Easy way to add project dependencies to tag index.

Done:
+ Handle long delay before background tagging begins for source trees or projects.
+ Handle long delay during startup because of hsqldb.
+ Option to include dependencies in active project tag searches.
+ Option for case-insensitive tag name DB queries. (also for the preview pane) 
+ Show progress during origin tagging.
+ Switch from using a relational database to Lucene.
+ Add project dependency properties. (To be integrated into PV later)
+ An action to add all existing projects to the DB.
+ An option to track project creation/removal and update the DB.
+ When jumping to a tag, verify that the line exists. The tag DB may be outdated.
+ Handle case when there is no active project when tag search is limited to active project.
  (e.g. group of projects is selected instead of an active project)
+ Preview dockable:
  + Support for multiple text areas (split edit pane)
  + Move tag query + file loading to worker thread
+ Context menu items to project viewer to add/remove the selected project.
+ Create an auto-preview dockable for definitions of the identifier under caret.
  Handle multiple definitions as a list in that dockable.
+ Project support:
  + Option pane in the plugin to define "watched" projects.
  + Monitor watched projects for changes (add/remove files) and auto-update DB.
  + Update DB when files belonging to a watched project are saved/loaded.
  + Option to limit searches to active project.
  + Actions option pane: SQL query "Jump to tag" actions.
  + Change column names to A_<attribute name>. Some attributes are also
    reserved words in SQL and cannot be used as column names (e.g. union).
  + Redesign DB tables.
  + Option to limit tag searches to active project.
+ Auto-update DB when:
  + Watched buffer is saved
  + Watched buffer is loaded
  + Files are added to / removed from watched projects.
+ Add project name or id to each tag in the table.
+ Update to released PV: tags/pv_2_1_3_7
