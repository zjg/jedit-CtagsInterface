<p>
CtagsInterface provides source code tagging functionality using the "Exuberant Ctags" tool (http://ctags.sourceforge.net). It automatically invokes Ctags on a list of projects (or source code trees) and keeps the tag information in a Lucene index (http://lucene.apache.org/core/). It can automatically keep track of modifications to the projects (or source trees), re-run Ctags over the modified files and keep the index updated.
The plugin provides a "Follow tag" function which can be used to follow the tag under the caret, a "Tag preview" dockable which tracks the caret location and shows the definition of the tag under the caret automatically and code completion suggestions and tooltips.
</p>
<p>
In addition, CtagsInterface provides a convenient API to access the tag index, so that the tag information can be shared with other plugins as well, and to eliminate the need for other plugins to interface with Ctags directly.
</p>
<p>
CtagsInterface is highly-configurable and can make use of all the information provided by Ctags. All tag extensions are indexed and made available to other plugins by the API.
